# IPV6 Implementation
This project is for setting up IPV6 for an existing or new architecture in a secure banking framework standards, using AWS services.

**Overview**:
To enable IPV6 to an existing or new AWS architecture. The existing architecture taken in this project is as per the banking Industry framework. The existing architecture uses a Third party Firewall as the first source of interaction with web traffic, traffic from firewall is moved to Application load balancer - routing multiple sub domain traffic to different auto scaling group and EC2 instances

**Project Goals**
1. To allow application/ domain to accomodate IPV6 traffic as well.
2. To enable Geo Blocking to allow users from only specific Country.
3. Restrict data from having copies accross borders.
4. Collect Logs of web user traffic for auditting purpose.

**Services Used in the project**
1. IAM: Identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
2. EC2: Applciation is hosted on Amazon EC2 - Linux server.
3. Route 53: AWS managed DNS setup - create a public hosted zone using a dummy site and update records as attached to make accomodate IPV6 only for specific country of preference.
4. ELB: Application load balancer is used in Dual stack mode - allowing IPV6 and IPV4 global traffic.
5. S3: Store logs of ELB, WAF and firewall in S3 bucket.
6. Athena: Using athena create a database and table for analysing logs.
7. Third Party Firewall: As the architccture is for banking framework - a firewall(PaloAlto in this case) is used.
8. ASG: Web servers are placed in Auto scaling group for automatically accomodate growing/ declining web traffic.
9. RDS: Required data from application/ Web servers are stored, retrived to and from RDS databases. Mutli AZ deployment is done to have a Highly Available topology
10. Athena: The logs generated by WAF, ALB, Firewall are stored in S3 and analysis on the same is done using Athena queries.
